title: Navigation & Arena Development
description:  We have designed and created an arena to simulate an environment where the LIMO robot from AgileX robotics is able to test and perform certain functions like navigation, mapping, path planning and position localisation to manoeuvre the fabricated environment. Our arena design theme is based on Changi Airport Terminal 2. We will also be programming our LIMO robot to navigate the mazes of other teams.
skills: 
- SolidWorks (CAD)
- Mechanical Designing

# Simulated Testing Environment (Arena)
## Design Constraints
**Area/Sizing**: To utilize a plot of dimensions 1300 mm x 1500 mm.


**Budget**: Within a spending of $600.


**Theme**: Must reflect aesthetic and layout of Terminal 2.


**Variety of Materials**: Materials must be safe, durable, and reconfigurable and non-electronic.


**Robot Requirements**: Arena environment must be able to be mapped and is sufficiently traversable by provided Limo Robot of dimensions 320mm x 220mm.

## Designing the Environment
**Drafting Layouts**: Utilizing CAD software such as 3DSolidWorks to create possible layouts and come up with features as obstacles. This layout closely mirrors the theme of Changi Airport Terminal 2 and its iconic feature, the Holographic Waterfall.
