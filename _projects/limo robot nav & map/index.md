title: Navigation & Arena Development
description:  We have designed and created an arena to simulate an environment where the LIMO robot from AgileX robotics is able to test and perform certain functions like navigation, mapping, path planning and position localisation to manoeuvre the fabricated environment. Our arena design theme is based on Changi Airport Terminal 2. We will also be programming our LIMO robot to navigate the mazes of other teams.
